    <h2>Ugali - A Kenyan Delicacy</h2>
    <P>
        Ugali is a staple Kenyan dish made from maize flour and water, cooked into a dense, dough-like consistency. It is commonly served with vegetables, meat, or stews and is eaten by hand, using pieces to scoop up accompaniments. Simple yet filling, ugali is a key part of Kenyan cuisine.

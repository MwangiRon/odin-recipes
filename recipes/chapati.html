    <h2>Chapati - A Kenyan Delicacy</h2>
    <P>
        Chapati is a popular Kenyan flatbread made from wheat flour, water, salt, and oil. It is soft, layered, and slightly crispy on the outside, often served with stews, vegetables, or tea. Inspired by Indian cuisine, Kenyan chapati is a staple in many households and a favorite during special occasions.

    <h3>How to make Chapati</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Whole Wheat Flour (Atta): 2 cups (for a recipe that emphasizes whole wheat flour)</li>
        <li>All-Purpose Flour: 1 cup (for a recipe that uses both whole wheat and all-purpose flour)</li>
        <li>Water: ¾ cup to 1¾ cups (depending on the recipe)</li>
        <li>Oil: 1 to 2 tablespoons (used for flavor and to prevent sticking)</li>
        <li>Salt: ¼ to 1 tablespoon (for flavor)</li>
        <li>Self-Raising Flour: 1 kg (for a recipe that uses self-raising flour)</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Make sure the water is warm and stir the salt into it to dissolve.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Make a well in the middle of the flour and pour in the salted water, knead for about 2-3 minutes (it will be sticky but do not add any flour). Cover the dough with cling film and leave to rest for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Portion the dough into 6 balls, cover, and begin by rolling each one as thin as you can get it (without caring about the shape at this phase). Then drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil/ghee evenly across it, and a somewhat generous pinch of flour evenly across it before rolling and twirling it onto itself.

        </li>
        <li>Step 4: Heat the cast iron pan (medium heat) as you roll out the dough balls. Do not roll them too thin (otherwise, they will be tough).</li>
        <li>Place the chapati on the pan without oil and let it cook until it changes color on the top then flip it over and as the bottom cooks you can now add oil to the top. Flip it over again and add some oil to the now top then flip it back (so each side has been cooked twice). Each chapati should cook for at least 3 minutes and not more otherwise it will dry out.</li>
        <li>And that’s it! Store in an airtight container to retain moisture.</li>
    </ol>
